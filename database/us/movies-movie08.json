From that day forward the people have always honored his deeds with an annual festival. Of course, Ash isn't really much of a history buff—he's more interested in the Pokémon competition being held! Only when he wins and is asked to don the ceremonial role of Aura Guardian does Aaron's importance become clear—especially when Lucario emerges from Aaron's staff! Aaron isn't a hero to this long-dormant Pokémon—all Lucario remembers is the master that betrayed it!",
